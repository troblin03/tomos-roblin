            <h3>A bit more about me.</h3>
            <div class="more-tomos-content">
                <p>I have always been obsessed with how things worked.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It started as a kid when my Gramps gifted me a Chemistry reactions kit and from there I was hooked. Whilst I was at school this interest continued and I focused my energy on STEM subjects. I soon started a 'how things work' book, where I would write about things I found interesting, from Flamingos to space craft.</p>
                <br>
                <p>These interests led me to pursuing a Mechanical Engineering degree at Imperial College London, where I found real joy in simplifying complex, technical topics in a way that others could understand. However, I soon realised that my passion wasn't in the complex engineering systems that I was dealing with, it was in defining the problem for which the complex system could provide a solution.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This led to me pursuing a graduate role as a technology consultant where I soon specialised in product delivery. Having gained experience as a Business Analyst, Programme Manager, and Scrum Master, I was afforded the oppurtunity to gain Product Management experience and was immediately hooked. Being able to bridge user needs to UX and Development is exactly the intersection I enjoy being in and immediately had me feeling at home.</p>

            <h3>A few things that energise me.</h3>
            <div class="more-tomos-content">
                <p>It's not difficult for me to get excited about something, but there are definitely a few things that I find energise me and motivate me in particular.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>People - </em>There are few things that I find myself more passionate about than people. Whether it be those in my team or those interacting with my product, people are the reason we build. There's rarely anything more satisfying than sitting in a user research session and seeing a user seemlessly glide through a product. Equally, working in an efficient, motivated, well-oiled team makes work easy. My time as a Scrum Master taught me the value in this, and just how much work can go into ensuring a team has the tools at its disposal to deliver fast and with quality</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><em>Technology - </em>The world is going digital, and most of us interact with technology every day. Much of my spare time is spent reading and trying to understand the latest technology trends. Working at the cutting edge is where I feel comfortable, and I'm not afraid of being outside my comfort zone. As we move into 2024 one of my goals isto learn in public. Share what I have learnt so those, like me, who are often in non-technical roles can better understand the terms and abbreviations we hear on a daily basis.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><em>Learning - </em>One of the reasons I love Product Management is that you are constantly learning. You're talking to users, ideating with designers, and supporting engineers. Each of these groups are experts in what they do and learning from each and understanding parts of what they do energises me as we build a product from 0 to 1. Outside of Product Management, you'll often find me reading about something I find interesting or learning a new skill. If people have a North Star, learning is the one I follow.</li>

                    <p>One of my favourite things about London is the coffee. Around most corners there is an independent coffee shop. This led to me picking it up as something of a hobby and now a few years (and many Â£s later) I'm hooked. Any recommendations always welcome!</p>

                    <p>Sport has played a central part in my life since I can remember. My younger years I spent playing field hockey, achieving international caps at junior age groups and that really helped shape the direction I have taken my career. In more recent years I have found running to take center stage. In 2023 I completed the London Marathon and hope to tick more off the bucket list!</p>

                    <p>Another bug that I may have caught later than most - travel. I have been fortunate enough to travel many different parts of the world, from Sri Lanka to Los Angeles, some of my most treasured memories have come from these trips. This year I have Canada on the agenda in May and further down the line I hope to be able to work and travel in another counrty.</p>
